Month 12: Capstone Project
Topics: Design and implement a full backend application covering all learned concepts.

Projects: Develop a complete backend system, from design to deployment.

Resources: Choose a personal project idea or contribute to an open-source project.

Tough Project Scenarios
To challenge yourself and apply your skills, consider these detailed project scenarios:
Online Banking System
Requirements: User account management (registration, login, profile update), financial transactions (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), bill payments, loan applications, investment features.

Challenges: High security for financial data, compliance with banking regulations, handling large transaction volumes, real-time updates, integration with external systems like payment gateways and credit bureaus.

Features to Implement: Multi-factor authentication, secure data storage and transmission, transaction processing with rollback mechanisms, reporting and analytics for user activity and system performance, scalability for peak times.

Real-time Chat Application
Requirements: User messaging, group chats, real-time notifications.

Challenges: Low latency and high performance for real-time interactions, handling concurrency and synchronization of game states, security to prevent cheating and unauthorized access, scalability for many concurrent users.

Features to Implement: Real-time communication using WebSockets, message persistence, user presence tracking, scalable architecture for high user loads.

These projects will test your ability to integrate multiple backend technologies and handle complex, real-world scenarios.
