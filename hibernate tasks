Let’s build your **4-week Hibernate mastery plan**! 🚀  
I’ll structure it with **daily tasks**, **real-world problems**, and **weekly projects** to give you **deep-level understanding** and help you tackle complex Hibernate and JPA scenarios. 

By the end, you’ll be able to build and optimize complex systems like a pro. Let’s get to it! 👇

## 📅 **Week 1: Entity Lifecycle, State Management & Advanced Mappings**

### 🎯 **Goal:**  
Master entity states, lifecycle events, and handle complex entity mappings.

### 📘 **Daily Breakdown:**

- **Day 1:** Deep dive into **Entity Lifecycle** — State transitions, `persist()`, `merge()`, `detach()`, `remove()`.
  - **Problem:** Build a state tracker that logs every entity state change automatically.

- **Day 2:** Understand **Persistence Context** & Flushing Strategies.
  - **Problem:** Experiment with `FlushMode` options and measure performance for batch inserts.

- **Day 3:** Advanced **One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many** mappings.
  - **Problem:** Model a **User-Role-Permission** system with bidirectional associations.

- **Day 4:** Inheritance Mapping (`SINGLE_TABLE`, `JOINED`, `TABLE_PER_CLASS`).
  - **Problem:** Build a **payment system** with polymorphic entity inheritance (CardPayment, PayPalPayment, etc.).

- **Day 5:** **Embeddables, Composite Keys & Complex IDs**.
  - **Problem:** Model an **Order-Item** system with composite keys and embeddable value objects.

- **Day 6:** Customizing Hibernate **Naming Strategies & User Types**.
  - **Problem:** Create a **custom UserType** to map JSON fields to entity attributes.

- **Day 7:** Weekly Project — **E-Commerce Inventory System**.
  - Design entities, model relationships, and handle complex mappings (Products, Categories, Orders, Payments).
  - Implement **entity listeners** to log audit details (`@PrePersist`, `@PostUpdate`).

## 📅 **Week 2: Query Optimization & Caching Strategies**

### 🎯 **Goal:**  
Master Hibernate’s query capabilities, optimize performance, and avoid common pitfalls.

### 📘 **Daily Breakdown:**

- **Day 8:** JPQL, Criteria API & Native Queries.
  - **Problem:** Write dynamic product search queries with multiple filters using Criteria API.

- **Day 9:** **Fetching Strategies & the N+1 Problem**.
  - **Problem:** Fix an N+1 problem in a **Blog-Post-Comment** system using `JOIN FETCH`.

- **Day 10:** **Pagination & Result Streaming**.
  - **Problem:** Load a **million records** with pagination and measure query execution times.

- **Day 11:** Hibernate **First-Level Cache** & **Second-Level Cache**.
  - **Problem:** Implement a **2nd-level cache with EHCache** and measure cache hits/misses.

- **Day 12:** Query **Hints & Fetch Profiles**.
  - **Problem:** Use query hints to **optimize batch fetching** in a multi-entity query.

- **Day 13:** Profiling **Hibernate SQL Queries**.
  - **Problem:** Enable SQL logging, analyze execution plans, and refactor a slow query for optimization.

- **Day 14:** Weekly Project — **Blog Management System**.
  - Design entities with complex associations and caching.
  - Solve **performance bottlenecks** (N+1, caching issues, lazy loading problems).

## 📅 **Week 3: Transactions, Locking & Concurrency Control**

### 🎯 **Goal:**  
Handle complex transaction scenarios, implement locking, and prevent data corruption.

### 📘 **Daily Breakdown:**

- **Day 15:** **Transaction Management** & Propagation Rules.
  - **Problem:** Handle nested transactions with different propagation settings and test rollback behavior.

- **Day 16:** **Optimistic Locking** (`@Version`).
  - **Problem:** Simulate concurrent updates to a product's stock quantity — resolve conflicts with versioning.

- **Day 17:** **Pessimistic Locking** (`PESSIMISTIC_READ`, `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`).
  - **Problem:** Build a **ticket booking system** with pessimistic locks to prevent overbooking.

- **Day 18:** **Deadlocks & Lock Escalation**.
  - **Problem:** Simulate a **deadlock scenario** with concurrent transactions — resolve it by fine-tuning locks.

- **Day 19:** **Isolation Levels & Dirty Reads**.
  - **Problem:** Experiment with different **isolation levels** to prevent dirty, phantom, and non-repeatable reads.

- **Day 20:** **Outbox Pattern for Event-Driven Systems**.
  - **Problem:** Implement an **Outbox pattern** to reliably send events to Kafka after successful transactions.

- **Day 21:** Weekly Project — **Banking System**.
  - Design entities (Accounts, Transactions, Transfers) with locking & concurrency control.
  - Simulate high concurrency, implement conflict resolution, and log transaction states.

## 📅 **Week 4: Multitenancy, Sharding & Real-World Problems**

### 🎯 **Goal:**  
Handle multi-tenant architectures, large datasets, and real-world system challenges.

### 📘 **Daily Breakdown:**

- **Day 22:** **Multi-Tenancy Strategies** (`SCHEMA`, `DATABASE`, `DISCRIMINATOR`).
  - **Problem:** Build a **SaaS app** where each tenant’s data is isolated using schema-based multi-tenancy.

- **Day 23:** **Sharding & Partitioning**.
  - **Problem:** Split a **huge order table** into shards and implement a **shard-aware repository**.

- **Day 24:** **Bulk Inserts & Updates**.
  - **Problem:** Process **1 million records** with bulk inserts — optimize for minimal DB hits.

- **Day 25:** **Soft Deletes & Entity Auditing**.
  - **Problem:** Add **soft delete** functionality to an entity (`deletedAt` field) and build an **audit log**.

- **Day 26:** **Dynamic Schema Switching**.
  - **Problem:** Switch schemas dynamically based on user context without restarting the app.

- **Day 27:** **Handling Large Result Sets with Streaming**.
  - **Problem:** Stream-process a **massive dataset** without running out of memory.
